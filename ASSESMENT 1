This program defines a simple Car class with three attributes:
brand, model, and year. 
It creates two car objects, assigns values to their attributes, and prints the car details to the console.
The program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts in C++,
such as classes and object creation.
To run, simply compile and execute the code in any C++ compiler, and it will display the information of two cars.
