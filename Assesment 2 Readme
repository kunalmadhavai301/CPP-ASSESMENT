This program demonstrates inheritance in C++. It has three classes: cpp, sensitive, and oop.
The base class cpp outputs "I am a Coding Language".
The sensitive class inherits from cpp and adds "I am case sensitive language". 
The oop class inherits from sensitive and prints "I am an Object Oriented Programming language".
When you run the program, it shows the constructor messages in the order of inheritance.
